===


**The content of this repository has been moved to [Getting Started with Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (USART) Examples (Microchip Studio)](https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-examples/atmega4809-getting-started-with-usart-studio). Additionally, a repository containing MCC generated code examples for AVR128DA48 with the same functionality can be found at [Getting Started with Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART) Examples (MPLAB X)](https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-examples/avr128da48-getting-started-with-usart-mplab-mcc). This repository is obsolete and it will not be maintained.**


This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for USART as described in [Getting Started with USART](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/TB3216-Getting-Started-with-USART-90003216B.pdf) document from Microchip.
The repository contains an Atmel Studio Solution with multiple projects inside. Make sure you have the necessary tools:
1. ATmega4809 device (recommended is evaluation board ATmega4809 X-plained PRO)
2. Atmel Studio
3. ATmega4809 Device Packs
4. Serial terminal emulator (eg. Data Visualizer, Tera Term)
5. UART to USB module (eg. MCP2200)

The following examples are inside this repository:
1. Send “Hello World” to a Terminal
2. Send Formatted Strings/Send String Templates Using Printf
3. Receive Control Commands
4. Asynchronous USART
5. One Wire USART

This source code is compatible with the following devices: ATtiny402, ATtiny202, ATtiny1604, ATtiny804, ATtiny404, ATtiny204, ATtiny1606, ATtiny806, ATtiny406, ATtiny1607, ATtiny807, ATtiny412, ATtiny212, ATtiny1614, ATtiny814, ATtiny414, ATtiny214, ATtiny3216, ATtiny1616, ATtiny816, ATtiny416, ATtiny3217, ATtiny1617, ATtiny817, ATtiny417, ATmega4808, ATmega3208, ATmega1608, ATmega808, ATmega4809, ATmega3209, ATmega1609, ATmega809.
