(TB3216) ATmega4809 USART Examples
===

This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for USART as described in [Getting Started with USART](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Getting-Started-with-USART-90003216A.pdf) document from Microchip.
The repository contains an Atmel Studio Solution with multiple projects inside. Make sure you have the necessary tools:
1. ATmega4809 device (recommended is evaluation board ATmega4809 X-plained PRO)
2. Atmel Studio
3. ATmega4809 Device Packs
4. Serial terminal emulator (eg. Data Visualizer, Tera Term)
5. UART to USB module (eg. MCP2200)

The following examples are inside this repository:
1. Send “Hello World” to a Terminal
2. Send Formatted Strings/Send String Templates Using Printf
3. Receive Control Commands
4. Asynchronous USART
5. One Wire USART

This source code is compatible with the following devices: ATtiny402, ATtiny202, ATtiny1604, ATtiny804, ATtiny404, ATtiny204, ATtiny1606, ATtiny806, ATtiny406, ATtiny1607, ATtiny807, ATtiny412, ATtiny212, ATtiny1614, ATtiny814, ATtiny414, ATtiny214, ATtiny3216, ATtiny1616, ATtiny816, ATtiny416, ATtiny3217, ATtiny1617, ATtiny817, ATtiny417, ATmega4808, ATmega3208, ATmega1608, ATmega808, ATmega4809, ATmega3209, ATmega1609, ATmega809.
